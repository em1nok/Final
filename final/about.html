All the armies are driven by the desire to see how seven idols from BTS leave their mark on music, and actively help their favorites in this.ARMY is not just a fan base. They have used their power for social and political action around the world. More accurately, it can be described as a global movement for social justice. According to Esquire, the fandom raised money for rainforest restoration, food for refugees and whale rescue. BTS fans paid for dance lessons for talented children in Rwanda and improved the Internet in rural areas so that schoolchildren could study normally during the pandemic.BTS and ARMY have become the flagships of the new dynamics of fandom: instead of exchanging postcards and gifts, fans collect donations. They transform the world around them day after day in the name of the love of pop music. Armies can do a lot and do a lot in order to be worthy of the love of their idols. The power of fandom is growing year after year, and its influence has long gone beyond k-pop.</p>
